Automated Driving
AC-77 - When the driver selects automated driving mode, the ADS shall engage within 3 seconds, provided all safety conditions met.
AC-78 - When the driver manually intervenes, the ADS shall disengage immediately (within 200 ms).
AC-79 - While ADS is engaged, continuously monitor subsystem health, alerting driver within 500 ms if degraded.
AC-80 - While Automated Driving System is engaged - the vheicle will stay within the lane - always
AC-81 - While Automated Driving System is engaged - the vheicle will leave the lane when a pedestrian is in front


Perception
AC-83 - The Perception subsystem shall detect/classify objects within 200 m forward, 50 m lateral, accuracy > 95%.
AC-84 - While ADS mode active, Perception subsystem shall maintain object detection rate ≥ 20 Hz.
AC-85 - Perception shall not falsely classify stationary roadside objects as moving obstacles (>1 false per 1000 detections).
AC-86 - The Perception subsystem shall detect pedestrians within at least 150 meters ahead, maintaining a detection accuracy ≥98%.
AC-87 - While ADS is engaged, the subsystem shall classify pedestrian intentions (stationary/moving) correctly with accuracy ≥95%.
AC-88 - When Reverse_Gear is selected, the Backup_Camera_System shall display the rearview image within 2.0 s.


Braking
AC-90 - When braking command issued, Braking subsystem shall initiate deceleration within 50 ms, accuracy ±0.2 m/s².
AC-91 - While ADS engaged, Braking subsystem shall report brake health status every ≤100 ms.


Throttle
AC-93 - When throttle command issued, subsystem shall achieve acceleration/speed within 100 ms, accuracy ±0.1 m/s².
AC-94 - While ADS engaged, Throttle subsystem shall continuously report throttle position/status every ≤100 ms.


HMI
AC-96 - When ADS mode engages/disengages, system shall notify driver visually/audibly within 200 ms.
AC-97 - While ADS engaged, system shall provide continuous visual ADS status indication, readability ≥99%.
AC-98 - When ADS encounters error/degraded subsystem, system shall alert driver visually/audibly within 500 ms with guidance.
AC-99 - When ADS is active, the steering wheel illumination shall turn solid green within 200 ms to clearly indicate automated control.
AC-100 - When driver intervention is required, the steering wheel illumination shall flash red at a frequency of 1–2 Hz within 200 ms.
